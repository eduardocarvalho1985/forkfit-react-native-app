I can see the iOS build issues clearly from the logs. The main problems are Firebase Auth configuration for React Native and missing React component exports. Let me analyze this and create a comprehensive technical guidance document.


Created iOS_BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md

Edited replit.md
I've created a comprehensive iOS build troubleshooting guide that addresses all the issues shown in your logs. The main problems are:

Firebase Auth not configured for React Native - needs AsyncStorage dependency and proper initialization
Missing React component exports - all route files need default exports
Authentication persistence - requires proper Firebase Auth setup for mobile
The guide provides step-by-step solutions including:

Installing @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
Proper Firebase Auth configuration with persistence
Template code for all missing route components
Environment variable setup
Build and debugging processes

Edited MOBILE_DEBUG_FIXES.md

Executed ls -la *.md | grep -E "(iOS|MOBILE)" | head -5
Perfect! I've created comprehensive technical documentation for the iOS build issues. The documentation includes:

iOS_BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md - Complete technical analysis with:

Root cause analysis of Firebase Auth registration errors
Step-by-step solutions for AsyncStorage integration
Template code for fixing missing component exports
Environment configuration for proper Firebase setup
Build and debugging procedures
MOBILE_DEBUG_FIXES.md - Quick reference for immediate fixes:

Critical dependency installation
Firebase Auth configuration changes
Route component export templates
Environment variable setup
Clean build commands
The main issues identified from your logs are:

Firebase Auth not configured for React Native (missing AsyncStorage persistence)
Missing default exports in route components
Environment variables not properly configured for Expo
You can share these guides with the other Replit assistant to resolve the iOS build issues. The solutions address all the specific errors shown in your build logs and should get the mobile app running properly on iOS.
