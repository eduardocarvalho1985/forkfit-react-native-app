# Separate Repository Strategy

## Current Setup
- **Web App Repo**: ForkFit main project (this repl)
- **Mobile App Repo**: New standalone repository (mobile repl)

## Repository Structure

### Web App Repository (this one)
- Main branch: Production web app
- Mobile-app branch: Can be archived/deleted later
- Backend API serves both web and mobile
- Documentation and shared resources

### Mobile App Repository (new)
- React Native/Expo project
- Independent development
- Connects to web app's API
- Own deployment pipeline

## Shared Resources Strategy

### Copy to Mobile Repo:
- API documentation
- Firebase configuration guide
- Shared types and interfaces
- Connection setup instructions

### Keep Synchronized:
- API endpoint changes
- Authentication flow updates
- Database schema changes
- Environment variables

## Development Workflow

1. **Backend Changes**: Make in web app repo
2. **Mobile Development**: Work in mobile repo
3. **API Updates**: Document and share between repos
4. **Testing**: Mobile app tests against web app's running API

## Future Migration Plan

When ready to merge repositories:
1. Create mobile/ folder in web repo
2. Move mobile code as subdirectory
3. Set up monorepo structure
4. Unified CI/CD pipeline

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Create new GitHub repository for mobile app
2. Push current mobile code to new repo
3. Copy essential documentation
4. Configure mobile app to connect to web API
5. Test the connection

## Benefits of This Approach

- Clean separation of concerns
- Independent deployment schedules
- Reduced Git complexity during development
- Clear ownership of platform-specific code
- Easy to manage different team members
